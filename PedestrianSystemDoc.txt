Pedestrian system ***** v1.0:

Current features & blueprints:

AI_Pedestrian: Manages NPC behaivor
NPC_Point: Actor that are sampled for the pedestrians to move to.
BP_PointManager: Spline based path creation, NPC_Poitns are created along the spline.
BP_NPCManager: Manages the areas for NPCs to be spawned as well as the amount of NPC to be spawned in that areas. Works along with the BPI_NPCManager to add or 
remove NPC from pool based on distance from the player (Vehicle in test case).
BPI_NPCManagement: Blueprint interface that keeps record of pooled NPC.

System current state needs: 

- NavBoundsVolume for NPC to be able to walk.
- NavModifierVolume to remove nav areas where NPC shouldn't walk
-NPC point has to be added as a new channel in project settings/Engine Collision/ObjectChannels

System optimization to be done:

- Implementing fixed NPC sample point to move to / Random fixed NPC sample point to move to
- Optimize sample method
- Implementing multiple NPC states (idle/walking/ other possible animations)
- NPC/Vehicle actor detection to avoid pedestrian and vehicle collision.
